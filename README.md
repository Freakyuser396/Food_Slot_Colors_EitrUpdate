# Food Slot Colors
The goal of this mod is to make it easier to know what food combinations you ate. If you eat a food that gives more health, the slot will be red. If you eat a food that gives more stamina, the slot will be yellow.

## Features
- Change food slot color based on food inside it.
- If food health > stamina, then slot = red
- If food health = stamina, then slot = default color
- if food health < stamina, then slot = yellow

## Compatibility
- Fully compatible with all food mods.
- Partially compatible with BetterUI. If you enable 'customFoodBar' in BetterUI, Food Slot Colors will not work. Otherwise, they are compatible.
